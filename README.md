I have completed the project on the topic "Cat vs Dog Classifier" under the guidance of Bharat Intern. Cats&Dogs.ipynb consists of the code of the model to predict if the entered image is of Cat or Dog. If the image is of Cat then the model will return 0. If the image is of Dog then the model will return 1. The output is within the code file only. The output of every line of code is displayed after its execution.
